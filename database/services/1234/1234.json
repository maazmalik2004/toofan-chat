Its central component is a knowledge base (KB), a set of sentences representing assertions about the world.  Each time it's called, the agent tells the KB about its inputs (percepts), asks the KB what action to perform, and then updates the KB with the selected action before executing it.  This process allows the agent to incorporate new information, update its understanding of the world, and deduce appropriate actions, even in situations with partial observability.\n"
