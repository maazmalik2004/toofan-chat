Specifically, gravity curves the paths of light.\n\nGravity bends light's path due to the equivalence principle.  This principle equates the effects of a gravitational field with those of an accelerated frame of reference.  Consequently, light's path curves in the presence of gravitational forces.\n\nI am unable to answer your question. While the provided text mentions that light paths are bent by gravitational forces, it does not specify the factors influencing this bending, such as the mass of the object or the distance from it.\n\n"
