Specifically, gravity curves the paths of light.\n\nGravity bends light's path due to the equivalence principle.  This principle equates the effects of a gravitational field with those of an accelerated frame of reference.  Consequently, light's path curves in the presence of gravitational forces.\n\nI am unable to answer your question. While the provided text mentions that light paths are bent by gravitational forces, it does not specify the factors influencing this bending, such as the mass of the object or the distance from it.\n\n"

A knowledge-based agent navigates this environment, aiming to find gold while avoiding a Wumpus (a deadly beast) and bottomless pits.  The agent possesses a single arrow to kill the Wumpus.  Clues such as stench (near the Wumpus), breezes (near pits), and glitter (indicating gold) aid navigation.\n\nThe Wumpus world involves navigating a cave containing a Wumpus, pits, and gold.  Rooms adjacent to the Wumpus smell, those near pits have a breeze, and gold is indicated by glitter.  The Wumpus can be killed by shooting an arrow while facing it, resulting in a scream heard throughout the cave.  The goal is to retrieve the gold and escape, with points awarded for success and penalties for death (by Wumpus or pit) or actions taken.  The game ends upon death or escape.\n\nThe goal in the Wumpus world is to retrieve the gold and exit the cave while avoiding death by the Wumpus or falling into a pit.\n\nI cannot answer this question.  The provided text describes the rules and components of the Wumpus World game, but it does not offer strategies for playing it.\n\nI cannot answer this question.  The provided text describes the basic Wumpus World game but does not offer information on variations or extensions.\n\n"

This effect is independent of the clocks' motion.\n\n"
