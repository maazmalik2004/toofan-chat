            "content": "Gravity affects light by curving its path.  This is because gravity affects anything that carries energy, and light, while massless, carries energy.\n\nLight paths are curved by gravity.\n\nGravitational lensing causes light from a distant star to bend as it passes a massive object.  This can result in the observation of an Einstein ring (a ring of light) or, if the objects aren't perfectly spherical, multiple images of the star.\n\nGravity, which is a manifestation of spacetime curvature, bends the path of light.  In regions of strong gravitational forces, light does not travel in straight lines but follows curved paths.\n\n"

The provided text mentions gravity's effects on satellites and light, but it does not define gravity itself.\n\nI am unable to answer your question.  The provided text discusses the effects of acceleration and gravity on time, not clock speed.\n\nGravity slows down clocks;  this effect, known as time dilation, impacts all clocks, including biological ones.  A twin traveling to a region of strong gravity would return younger than their twin remaining in a region of weaker gravity.  This is separate from time dilation caused by the clocks' motion.\n\nYes, gravity's effect on time, known as time dilation, does impact clock speed.  Clocks slow down in the presence of gravitational forces.\n\nGravitational forces cause clocks to slow down.  A clock in a gravitational field will run slower than an identical clock far from such influences. This effect is a consequence of the fact that time itself is affected by gravity.\n\n"
