These can be consolidated into the following main categories:\n\n**1. Ethical Conduct and Compliance:** This is the most pervasive theme, encompassing adherence to laws (including anti-bribery, anti-corruption, AML/ATF, antitrust), internal policies, and a general commitment to ethical business practices. This includes fair dealing with all stakeholders (customers, competitors, vendors), responsible use of company assets, and maintaining financial integrity and transparency.\n\n**2.  Whistleblowing and Accountability:**  Robust mechanisms for reporting violations and concerns are consistently emphasized, alongside strong protections for whistleblowers and clear consequences for non-compliance. This includes investigations, disciplinary actions (up to termination), and a commitment to preventing retaliation.\n\n**3.  Information Security and Confidentiality:**  Protecting sensitive company information, including intellectual property, financial data, and employee information, is a recurring priority. This involves strict controls on access, responsible use of company systems, and prevention of insider trading.\n\n**4.  Employee Well-being and Workplace Culture:**  Several documents address creating a positive and safe work environment, including commitments to workplace health and safety, diversity and inclusion, zero tolerance for harassment, and promoting employee well-being.\n\n**5.  Conflict of Interest Management:**  Several sections address potential conflicts of interest, particularly emphasizing disclosure requirements for personal interests that could influence professional decisions or create an unfair advantage.\n\n\nThese five categories represent the core values and principles underpinning Zomato's internal governance structure, as reflected across the various documents summarized.\n"
